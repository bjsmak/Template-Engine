# Template-Engine

The purpose of this application is to demonstrate the use of node.js, classes, and jest testing through a team creator that can be used in the workplace.<br>
By running the app.js, the user can select an option to add a manager, intern, or engineer using inquirer prompts. Afterwards, a series of questions are asked to define the employee that are used in individual classes<br>

Once complete, the added team members in the array are pushed into the html page and a file is written to the output folder using path and fs. This can be done as many times as the user would like until 'None' is selected.<br>
